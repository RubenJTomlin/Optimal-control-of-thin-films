Solves the 2DKSE (9) with the optimal transverse control and initial condition (28) as discussed in Section 3 (Optimal transverse control for hanging films).

We use a 4th order BDF method in time, with spectral methods in space. The optimal control is computed using the explicit formula given in Section 3.

If kappa>=0, there are no linearly unstable transverse modes, and no controls are applied (the system remains bounded without controls).

Included are an executable (.exe) file, a data-file "data_mgd2KSE", and a matlab script which analyses the output.

The spatial (M,N) and temporal (dt) discretisations may be modified on the first line of the data-file, with the final time (Tfinal) on the second. The inclination parameter kappa, and the control parameters gamma and s are on the third line. The code allows the user to step in values of the streamwise length L1, "sizeLvec" determines the number of simulations at different values of L while maintaining the aspect ratio, starting at the value "L_1" with steps of size "stepL". The final line defines the aspect ratio of the domain, i.e. we write L1 = L and L2 = L^a. The choice of a=1 is thus a square domain. 

After completion, the code prints 7 files (examples are included):
- Fourier modes and corresponding spatial discretisations ("x_k1_..." and "y_k2_...")
- L2-norm and Linfinity-norm
- "profiles_..." contains a concatenation of the initial condition, final state, and magnitude of the Fourier coefficients at the final time.
- "unstable_..." contains the real and imaginary parts of the linearly unstable modes with positive wavenumbers, with the components of the zero-mode printed in the the first two columns (as a numerical check). Thus, if kappa>=0, there will be just two columns, and if the (0,+/-1), (0,+/-2),..., (0,+/-7) modes are linearly unstable, then there will be 2+2*7 columns.
- "control_..." contains the optimal controls with in direct correspondence with the state in "unstable_...".
