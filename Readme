Solves the 2DKSE (9) with the optimal transverse control and initial condition (28) as discussed in Section 3 (Optimal transverse control for hanging films).

We use a 4th order BDF method in time, with spectral methods in space. The optimal control is computed using the explicit formula given in Section 3.

If kappa>=0, there are no linearly unstable transverse modes, and no controls are applied (the system remains bounded without controls).

Included are an executable (.exe) file, a data-file, and a matlab script which analyses the output.
